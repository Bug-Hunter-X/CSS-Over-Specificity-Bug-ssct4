This repository demonstrates a subtle CSS bug related to over-specificity in selectors.  The bug arises from using a child selector (`>`), which limits style application to only direct children of the parent element. This can lead to unexpected behavior when you intend to style all elements within a container. The solution shows how to correct the issue and ensure styles are applied as intended.
